                     in the Gibbs sampling. This is solved in this version. Similar to the reported HPM.

main1.5.3.c		 ... 16-Jul-14 Incorporated the User option to specify the prior probabilities over the model space in exact approaches. 
                     I have introduced 
				     a change in the templates in main.c Now, instead of having the gConst specifying the template I have created tConst (t means template) with 
				     unspecified functions tConst, tmainalgebraics, tpriorprobs and tBF21fun that are replaced with the valid ones by makeMain        

main1.6.1.c      ... 30-Sep-14 The program has been rewritten to work without intercept (the variable selection is performed over all the
	                 covariates given in the design matrix). The main functions depend now on a new parameter pknull which specifies the number of
	                 fixed covariates in the original formulation. Additional changes in sources/auxiliaryfuncs

Gibbsauxiliaryfuncs.c .. 27-Oct-15 An optimized version (a new way to calculate Xindex matrix which is much faster)
